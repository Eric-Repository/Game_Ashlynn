# Game---Ashlynn
A game created when I was an undergrad at York University. I (Eric Lin) worked with: Hao Xu, Janus Chui, Rouming Lin to create this game.

This game was created on "Unity Game Engine". In this game you play as a girl that explores multiple biomes in her dreams. Each biome has its unique form that you can use. A dolphin in the ocean, a dinosaur in the city, and a bird in the sky.
Cellular automata was used to create the voxel terrain. Additionally, a seperate camera had its view rendered onto a plane to simulate/create a portal that would link the biomes.
